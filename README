The purpose of this assignment is to demonstrate an understanding of the RStudio, R Markdown and Knitr coding environments for data analysis. We have completed the exercises from an article (i.e. A (very) short introduction to R: https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Torfs+Brauer-Short-R-Intro.pdf) in RStudio and then compiled our code and results into a reproducible report generated by using RMarkdown along with Knitr.

The repository contains the following files:
	- README.txt:	- This document with a general description of the assignment
	- SRT411A0.Rmd:	- This is the knitr script which will generate a reproducible report with our codes and their generated results
	- SRT411A0.pdf:	- This is a pdf file generated to show the results of our code, generated with the knitr commands in RMarkdown
